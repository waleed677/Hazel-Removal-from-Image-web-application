# Hazel-Removal-from-Image-web-application
Images captured in poor weather conditions may lose their potential information, Particles and water droplets in an atmospheric veil.  Thus, these hazy images do not provide enough significant details for future vision applications Therefore, these kinds of applications demand haze removal technique as a preprocessing tool to improve the performance of vision applications (aerial imagery, object recognition, image retrieval and object analysis) under poor environmental conditions

In this project i used

-> python django framework to make this project as web application
-> implement the hazel removel algorithm to remove the hazel from the input image and show the output image without any hazel.

 # Things needed to run this project #
 
 -> Install python 
 -> Install Django
